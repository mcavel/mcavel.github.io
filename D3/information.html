    <body>Data was extracted from the 2014 Census and the BRFSS to examine the relationship between uninsured indviduals and those that pass over needed medical care.  Within the BFSS, respondents were asked <i>"Was there a time in the past 12 months when you needed to see a doctor but could not because of cost?</i>"  Responses were compared against uninsured rates by state from the US Census.  <p>There is a postive correlation <b>(+.57)</b> between the number of uninsured individuals within a state and individuals that "pass over" or skip needed medical care.  On the surface, this seems to imply that those without medical insurance do not have the financial resources and access to(or lack of) public funding/resources to resolve medical issues. </body>
